All experiments in the paper are included, in particular:
1. Matrix perturbation theoretical PIP loss upper bound;
2. Robustness to over-parametrization with respect to the exponent parameter;
3. Forward stability experiments
4. Optimal dimensionality for LSA/LSI and empirical optimal dimensionalities
5. Optimal dimensionality for Word2Vec/GloVe and empirical optimal dimensionalities
