Scripts for generating the upper bounds  

File | What's in it?
--- | ---
`upper_bd_est.py` | provides upper bound and ground truth using Monte-Carlo methods  
`upper_bd_est_alpha_0.py` | provides upper bound and ground truth using Monte-Carlo methods (the two upper bounds correspond to alpha=0 and 0<alpha<=1 for the main theorem; when alpha=0.5 we use the enhanced upper bound in the appendix)  
`plot_upper_bd.py` | visualize the upper bound  

The .pkl files are empirical spectrums from various datasets
